# Waypoint

Explore Learn Collect !

## What is it ?

Waypoint is a landmark game in which the goal is to go and explore new landmarks, collect memories near them and learn a fun fact or history tidbit about them.

Our code uses a react + vite frontend and a fastapi backend to run the stack.

To run the webservice and static website, we used Render.com (or you can run on localhost:5173 too!)

For database management, we have used Supabase.

API's used: Supabase (Managing landmarks + finding closest one) and Leaflet (Online Map)

Libraries Used: React, Fastapi, Python Libaries, npm (uuid, and pretty much everything frontend)
